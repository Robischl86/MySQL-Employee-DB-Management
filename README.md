## Installation
The application requires mysql and inquirer.
## Usage
Copy and paste the schema in the employee.sql file into a MySQL workbench and run the query. Once the employeeDB is created, users can run the application through Node. Once executed, the application will present the user with a list of actions, such as viewing all employees or managers, viewing employees by manager/department, adding or removing employees, or updating employee profiles. Each employee will be assigned an id number that auto-increments with each new employee.
